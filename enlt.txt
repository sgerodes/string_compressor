This literature review gives an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of Big Data. 


1. What is Big Data?

The concept of Big Data is a significant global problem that is known not only in the area of informatics but also in many other sectors. Again and again, we hear about it in the media. But what does this term mean? 

Big Data refers to the dynamic, huge volumes of data generated by people, tools, and machines. The amounts of stored information are growing exponentially. According to the New Jersey Institute of Technology [I], there will be 13 000 Exabytes of data produced in 2020, compared to 2160 in 2014. These enormous amounts of data need innovative technologies for the collection, storage, analytical process, and data protection. In the last few decades, companies have collected a lot of data, but most of them avoid to analysing them. The governmental and the business sectors expect Big Data and information itself to be the oil of the 21st century [II]. 









2. Advantages and disadvantages

This chapter will discuss the pros and cons of the Big Data analysis spreading.

2.1 Possibilities and opportunities

According to many scientists and entrepreneurs, Big Data is the holy grail of the near future [IV]. Good analysis can create competitive advantages, such as an increase in productivity and product quality, costs reduction, and better customer communication. Through the intelligent analysis of large amounts of data, one can explore many connections. These findings can be valuable for all, large and small companies as well as governments, individual people and also for society.

There is a widespread opinion that epidemics and natural disasters can be predicted in a way that their effect will produce little damage. Governments can fight terrorists in a more efficient way and more effective laws could be created. Data policing embodies a dual nature between the protection of its citizens and the breaching of privacy, but there are a lot of ways achieve both.

Software already exists that can be a good helper in the work with Big Data. The free framework Hadoop, for example, uses such companies Facebook, IBM, Yahoo. Many large corporations, such as Google, with its roots in data processing, have developed unique and powerful algorithms for data processing and information analysis. But nevertheless, the most classical statistics and analysis systems are not able to handle these quantities.

In the world of Big Data scientists are facing following challenges: fast import of large amounts of data, real-time processing, short response times, analysis of various types of information, and the possibility for processing many concurrent queries. In spite of some good software, such as Hadoop, the development of the information processing is still in the early phase [V].

There are of course also counterexamples, where a lot of time and money was invested in the collection, storage and the analysis of large amounts of data, but in the end, no relevant results were generated. For example, through the analysis of the priorities of the restaurant visitors in the United States, it was found that people much rather go in an open restaurant as in closed. This information has no value neither for the firm nor for humanity.

2.2 Problems 

The problem is clear: the companies still have no effective system of data processing. A recently conducted study by the Pew Research Center [VI] and the Imagining the Internet Center of Elon University showed that people are not yet capable of understanding and efficiently to applying Big Data. The lack of technical and professional know-hows is one of the most significant barriers that the company must face. The necessary data analysts, data scientists, and data architects are today very and scarce.

Computer science plays a major role in this branch. It is on the shoulders of computational mathematics to find efficient algorithms, which can enable the collection, processing, and protection of mass data.

Of course, physical limits stand in our way. Big data requires large databases and storage possibilities. There are high risks to lose that data. Few companies can afford to make a copy of 1000 TB. The cost for all of the above is extremely high.

The collection of data can mean the violation of personal privacy [VII]. Information such as name, age, searching history, hobbies, or even credit card data are already an integral part of our profiles in social networks. If a web service is not taking enough consideration to protect the data people can run into many undesirable difficulties.

When companies pay too little attention to security, it could mean a disaster for the end user. For example, Facebook has made the mistake already several times through introducing add-ons such as “News Feed”, and “The Beacon”[VIII]. This has cost the social network a lot of users and put some people in unpleasant situations.

The question is: who is allowed to have access to the collected data and the results of the data investigation and who should control this data stream? Above all, the social networks need to be put under the microscope. They produce, according to some studies, 75-85 percent of the world's data. In addition, Big Data touches the boundaries of ethics. Perhaps there are areas in which we should prefer the data to be undiscoverable.












3. Conclusion 

Big Data is both the problem as well as the approach to the solution. The problem is to collect, store and analyse fast-growing amounts of data. Many companies collect data but they do not have the capabilities to process and analyse them.

A lot of areas and instruments remain unexplored in the world of Big Data. In my opinion, the information revolution provides a good future for specialists who develop algorithms and analysis methods for large databases. Big Data is an excellent example, of managers and computer scientists working as a team for an enormous economic and social value. As a conclusion, I would like to quote a Big Data expert and a TED talks speaker Kenneth Cukier [XI]: 
“The Big Data problem is similar to the primitive people and the fire. It is a powerful tool. But you have to handle it carefully or it will burn you”
